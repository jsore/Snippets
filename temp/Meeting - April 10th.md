#### Quotes from meeting:

- Job replacements are going to 3 possible countries: costa rica, indonesia, india?

- If someone leaves ( creating backfill ) we'll evaluate where the backfill should be filled from ( cheap country or US )

- Example: a tier 1 analyst leaves, or we can't afford to keep on team: that role will be moved out of US

- Positions currently empty and awaiting backfill will get filled by someone from low cost country

- Because we have resource constraints, we'll bring on headcount at expected attrition rate for the year

    - Backfilling to staffing level that was approved at beginning of year

    - These people are 'bubble-staff', only to handle natural attrition

- Federal is exempted, still need a US person to work in Fed

- Demisto to 'take up slack' for tier 1 SOC, and bubble-staff for personell requirements

- NEW STAFF NOT REPLACING CURRENT STAFF, they're only for new positions throughout year and to hedge against natural attrition

- Current staff is to train and evaluate new staff, whether or not if the trainees are from cheap countries

- Number of roles has been identified for the year, process to fill those rolls has been started

- Knowledge transfer plans have been identified, possible travel aspect may be included

A 'best guess': IBM needs to eat RedHat aquisition cost (34b), they'll be placed in the Cloud group

#### Questions:

- IBM has in the past moved engineering teams oversees to varying degrees success/failure, how is this going to be made different this time?

    - look at failures in case-by-case basis
    - not replacing staff, augmenting only
    - Jake, Jason, heavily involved in the candidate hiring process
    - caveat: yes, we will need to train them but we're trying to get the best people out of these countries

<br>

- Will this affect internal raises, promotions?

    - yes, it possibly will
    - we do promote from within if we can but do look at all available candidates
    - when considering a riase or promotion, we'll need to provide a business justification as to why we can't move the job oversees
    - if there isn't a reason it can't move, it goes over sees

<br>

- Raises?

    - 'fully burdened rate' potential for salary, benefits, how much needs to be spent on person
    - IBM judges each person the same way for every person in company
    - not looking at how much it costs to keep the person, they're looking at average costs for a person across a country


- Does this decision affect all departments under your umbrella?

    - yes, any attrition in any department, a review is had to determine validity of keeping role in the US


- is there a final decision of which 3 countries to concentrate staffing efforts?

    - roles and numbers are already alligned with one of the countries
    - we are deploying into all 3 countries
    - people identified do satisfy skillsets and business requirements
    - possible: hungary, poland
    - other teams may deploy into other countries that meat their requirements
    - SOC replacements are being deployed across all 3 countries already scoped


any further questions: go to Jason, Jake but Allen is available via slack, email, will be answered in a public forum
